Please write a program that checks the Tick Tack Toe game table provided
as input in form of a text (CSV) file (ticktacktoe.txt).
The program should print if the game is over and if so who one (X,O or nobody).

Hints:
1. It will simplify code if you use 1 and -1 to represent the X and O respectively
and 0 to represent an empty field.
2. You may need to parse the values read from the file as text (String) into numbers.
To do that use:
String s = "55";
int a = Integer.parseInt(s);
